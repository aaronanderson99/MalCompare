ABOUT

libsvm_oc is a library for One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that 
operate on n-gram objects from the libstem library. It uses libsvm patched with 
the SVDD patch for one-class SVM support, and extends it to support libstem 
n-gram objects. 

libsvm_oc is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 or any later version.

The SVDD patch:
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/#libsvm_for_svdd_and_finding_the_smallest_sphere_containing_all_data

The library is currently distributed as a part of PJScan. It is not considered 
feature-complete nor ready to be used as a stand-alone One-Class Support Vector 
Machine library because of stability reasons.
