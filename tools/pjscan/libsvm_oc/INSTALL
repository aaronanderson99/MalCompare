INSTALLATION NOTES

libsvm_oc has been successfully installed on Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04. Other 
configurations have not been tested. The library does not link to any third 
party code, so in theory it should be portable to other operating systems and 
architectures with some effort. If you succeed in doing that, please notify 
the maintainer. 

PREREQUISITES

The following Debian packages are required: 

	cmake	(source code building)
	g++ 	(compiler)
	swig	(optional, used for Python API generation)
	python-dev	(optional, used for Python API)

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

The recommended method of installation is as follows:

	0. Install prerequisites
	1. Go to the project root 
	2. Make a new directory (e. g. 'build') and go to this directory. 
	3. Run cmake with all the options. This way the source will be built out of 
	the source directory. The options are as follows: 
		a) -DMAKE_API=1 - makes a Python API 
		b) -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={Release, Debug} - builds a release or debug 
		configuration. Release configuration is recommended (enables compiler 
		optimizations). 
	4. Run make
	5. As root, run make install

EXAMPLE

In this example, libsvm_oc source is located in the 
'/home/user123/sources/libsvm_oc/' directory. The Python API is built as well.

sudo apt-get install cmake g++ swig python-dev
cd /home/user123/sources/libsvm_oc/
mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DMAKE_API=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
sudo make install
