libpdfjs has been successfully installed on Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04. Other 
configurations have not been tested.

PREREQUISITES

The following Debian packages are required: 

	cmake 
	libpoppler-dev 
	g++ 
	swig (optional, used for Python API)
	python-dev (optional, used for Python API)

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

The recommended method of installation is as follows:

	0. Install prerequisites
	1. Go to the project root
	2. Make a new directory (e. g. 'build') and go to this directory. 
	3. Run cmake with all the options. This way the source will be built out of 
	the source directory. The options are as follows: 
		a) -DMAKE_API=1 - makes a Python API 
		b) -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={Release, Debug} - builds a release or debug 
		configuration. Release configuration is recommended (enables compiler 
		optimizations). 
		c) -DMAKE_TESTS=1 - builds the test example
	4. Run make
	5. As root, run make install

EXAMPLE

In this example, libpdfjs source is located in the 
'/home/user123/sources/libpdfjs/' directory. The Python API and the test 
examples are built as well.

sudo apt-get install cmake libpoppler-dev g++ swig python-dev
cd /home/user123/sources/libpdfjs/
mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DMAKE_API=1 -DMAKE_TESTS=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
sudo make install
