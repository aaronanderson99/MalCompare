INSTALLATION NOTES

libstem has been successfully installed on Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04. Other 
configurations have not been tested. The library does not link to any third 
party code, so in theory it should be portable to other operating systems and 
architectures with minimal effort. If you succeed in doing that, please notify 
the maintainer. 

PREREQUISITES

The following packages are used: 

	cmake	(source code building)
	g++ 	(compiler)
	swig	(optional, used for Python API generation)
	python-dev	(optional, used for Python API)
	libboost-test-dev	(optional, used for unit tests)

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

The recommended method of installation is as follows:

	0. Install prerequisites
	1. Go to the project root 
	2. Make a new directory (e. g. 'build') and go to this directory. 
	3. Run cmake with all the options. This way the source will be built out of 
	the source directory. The options are as follows: 
		a) -DMAKE_API=1 - makes a Python API 
		b) -DMAKE_TESTS=1 - makes unit tests
		c) -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={Release, Debug} - builds a release or debug 
		configuration. Release configuration is recommended (enables compiler 
		optimizations). 
	4. Run make
	5. As root, run make install

EXAMPLE

This is an example for the installation of libstem. In this example, libstem 
was located in the '/home/user123/sources/libstem/' directory. The project is 
built with a Python API and unit tests. The unit tests are run.

sudo apt-get install cmake g++ swig python-dev libboost-test-dev
cd /home/user123/sources/libstem/
mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DMAKE_API=1 -DMAKE_TESTS=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
./test/test_kernel
./test/test_ngram
sudo make install
