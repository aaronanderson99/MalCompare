DESCRIPTION

libstem is a library for embedding of string n-grams into vector spaces. It 
supports different embeddings (count, frequency, binary, normalized and
binary normalized), operations between n-grams (addition, subtraction, dot 
product, multiplication with a constant) and computation of different kernels 
(linear and radial basis function kernels). 

libstem is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 or any later version.

The library is currently distributed as a part of PJScan. It is not considered 
feature-complete nor ready to be used as a stand-alone embedding library 
because of performance reasons.
