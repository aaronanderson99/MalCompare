DESCRIPTION

This project consists of a small patch to the Mozilla Spidermonkey JavaScript 
engine, that makes the engine output lexical tokens of the specified JavaScript 
source code. The tokens are encoded as numerical values that are used as input 
to other parts of PJScan. The engine is modified to exit before any JavaScript 
source code is actually executed for performance and security reasons. 

The patch consists of two files in the unified diff format: 
	1. jsscan.h.patch
	2. jsscan.cpp.patch

The patch is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 or any 
later version.
