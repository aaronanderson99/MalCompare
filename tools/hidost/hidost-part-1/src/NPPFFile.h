/*!
 * \brief A class representing a file in the Null-terminated PDF Path Format
 * (NPPF).
 *
 * An NPPF file has a header in this form: NPPF\0\0\n
 * All other lines in the file are PDF paths with individual path segments
 * (PDF names that make up the path) delimited with null-bytes (\0). There is
 * an extra null-byte at the end of each path, just before the newline (\n)
 * byte. This extra null-byte marks the end of the path. It is easily found
 * programatically as it comes right after the null-byte of the last path
 * segment of that path, so it is the only occurence of two consecutive
 * null-bytes.
