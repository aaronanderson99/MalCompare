DESCRIPTION

For a detailed description of Mimicus, please refer to the "README - Mimicus.rst" 
file.

INSTALLATION

(Note: The setup script assumes that you have already installed Python 2.7 and
Pip.)

- Run "./setup_mimicus.sh" in the mimicus directory to install dependencies.
- Run "./run_mimicus.sh TEST_DIR" in the mimicus directory to run experiments,
where TEST_DIR is the directory of your testing files. This will create an
attack.list file containing all testing PDFs that will be run through the
models, then run the experiments and output their results in
results_PDFrate_RandomForest.txt and results_PDFrate_SVM.txt, both in the
mimicus directory.
- The run_mimicus.sh script only tests against the SVM model, as this returned
the best results; however, you can instead (or additionally) run the Random
Forest model by uncommenting the last line (removing the # sign at the start).
